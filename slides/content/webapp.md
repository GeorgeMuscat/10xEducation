### Server

A computer that "serves" resources to clients.

1. Browser makes request to the frontend server
2. Frontend server responds with page code
3. Browser makes request to backend server
4. Backend server queries database server
5. Database responds with data to the backend server
6. Backend server processes and returns data to browser
