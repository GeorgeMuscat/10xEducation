### Backend

The part of a web application that handles business logic, database interactions, and server-side operations.

### Server

A computer that "serves" resources to clients.

3. Browser makes request to backend server
4. Backend server queries database server
5. Database responds with data to the backend server
6. Backend server processes and returns data to browser
